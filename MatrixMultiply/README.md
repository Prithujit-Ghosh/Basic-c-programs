_**Matrix Multiplication in C Overview**_

This project implements matrix multiplication in the C programming language using nested loops and two-dimensional arrays. The program takes user input for matrix dimensions and elements, validates the conditions for multiplication, performs the computation, and displays the resulting matrix.

Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in linear algebra with applications in computer graphics, data science, and numerical computation.

**_Features_**

Takes user input for both matrices (rows, columns, and elements).

Validates if matrix multiplication is possible (column count of first equals row count of second).

Uses nested loops to compute the product of two matrices.

Displays the resulting matrix in a formatted output.

**_Prerequisites_**

C compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)

Basic understanding of arrays and loops in C

_**Code Explanation**_

The program follows a structured sequential flow:

Input Stage:

Prompts the user to enter rows and columns for both matrices.

Reads all elements of both matrices using loops.

_**Validation:**_

Checks if the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second matrix.

Terminates the program if multiplication is not possible.

_**Computation:**_

Multiplies the two matrices using three nested loops.

Prints each element of the resulting matrix with indices for clarity.

_**How to Compile and Run**_

Save the program as matrix_multiplication.c

Open a terminal or command prompt

_**Compile the code:**_

**bash**
gcc matrix_multiplication.c -o matrix_multiplication
**Run the executable:
**
**bash**
./matrix_multiplication

**Example Output**
text
Enter the value of rows of first matrix: 2
Enter the value of columns of first matrix: 3
Enter the value of rows of second matrix: 3
Enter the value of columns of second matrix: 2
For the first matrix:
Enter the 1 row's 1 column's element:1
Enter the 1 row's 2 column's element:2
Enter the 1 row's 3 column's element:3
...
So the result of the multiplication is:
The 1 row's 1 column's element is:XX
The 1 row's 2 column's element is:YY
Known Limitations
Uses 1-based indexing, which is non-standard in C (arrays typically use 0-based indexing).

Does not handle invalid non-integer inputs.

Stack limitations may arise for very large matrices due to static array allocation.

Future Enhancements
Convert indexing to 0-based standard.

Add dynamic memory allocation using malloc() for larger matrices.

Include pretty-print formatting for matrix output.
